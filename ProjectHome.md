### What is Camelbox? ###
A complete build of Perl for 32-bit Windows that includes:

  * A nice Windows installer that automatically downloads and installs the correct archive files
  * All of the core Gtk2-Perl modules (Gtk2, Glib, Cairo), as well as their equivalent C libraries compiled for Windows.
  * A working CPAN module
  * Bonus (!) Perl modules, including DBI/DBD[SQLite|mysql|Pg|ODBC] and friends
  * Extra binaries, utilities, development libraries/headers for compiling even more Perl modules from CPAN
  * Lots of Perl/GTK documenation in HTML format
  * Windows shortcuts for applications, demos, documentation, and links to doumentation/tutorials on the web

all neatly packaged and ready to install!

Installing Camelbox should be easy (that's what we're here for), but if you want it broken down into a step-by-step process (with pretty screenshots), there's an InstallingCamelbox page just for you.  Once you perform the install, visit the UsingCamelbox page to see what you can test drive.  If you still have questions after [installing](InstallingCamelbox.md) and [using](UsingCamelbox.md) Camelbox, there's now a [FAQ](FAQ.md) page available as well.
